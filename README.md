# Dharma Swan Timer 

- The Dharma Swan Timer is an application inspired by the TV show Lost. The premise is simple: every 108 minutes, users must enter a designated code. This responsibility falls to the listed partners. Keep the timer ticking and stay true to the essence of the show with this interactive application.

## About Development

- This project represents my initial dive into JavaScript development. Based on the show Lost, I wanted to create a timer that required user input every 108 minutes, just like in the show. To bring this idea to life, I turned to YouTube tutorials for guidance on building the timer, and then took the initiative to develop the remaining logic independently. This venture marked my first exploration into DOM manipulation using JavaScript, a concept I found both challenging and rewarding. Additionally, it introduced me to incorporating sound effects into my projects, adding a dynamic element to the user experience. Despite the project's modest scale, it presented a considerable challenge for me when I was just a beginner. It took a long time to complete but once it was done, it expanded my skill set significantly.


## Planned Updates

- Add a way to add and remove partners.
